# Artificial Intelligence(CSE 202) Lab Work
Scripts, data sets and other files for the Lab Practical of Artificial Intelligence(CSE 202).

Following Lab assignments have been added to this repo.

## Implementing [POS tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)

The aim of this practical is to achieve Part of Speech(POS) tagging using HunPos(HMMs model) and CRF++(CRF model). All the other details can be seen in the sub-folder.

## Chunking

All the details can be seen in the sub-folder.

## Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi

The aim here is to deduce the tags, words, transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and prior probabilities using some training data and then use these to predict POS tags using Viterbi's Algorithm.
